	     <h2> Week 2 </h2>
	     <p> This week was the first week we were supposed to get in contact with our groups and meet. As we planned on meeting we discussed our availability a little in the group discussion board. It was a bit of a struggle to get everyone to comment but we were able to get three of us confirmed to meet on Thursday night. Thursday night we met and talked about how we want to go about this class and what days we would like to meet. We set up a schedule of times and who was teaching each week along with who was leading the meeting.</p>
	     
	     <h2> Week 3 </h2>
	     <p> This week I was preparing to teach about my first topic, which was JavaScript – Object Creation Functions, Properties, Methods, Instantiation. Jason was also teaching this week with loops conditional statements, functions and arrays. Logan was our lead for this meeting. I was a little nervous for the first week topic because I didn’t know what to expect. With my topic being something, I have learned about in the past, it wasn’t as bad as I thought it was going to be. </p>
    
	     <h2> Week 4 </h2>
	     <p> Week 4 was one I was happy I wasn’t teaching in. I had tried to learn about JSON before and was just confused by it. It was nice to be the leader of the meeting because I think it helped me pay more attention and learned a lot more than I think I would have if I wasn’t the leader. I was finishing up the first two topics at this time </p>
	     
	     <h2> Week 5 </h2>
	     <p> Week 5 I was finished with the first two topics and was working on the third and forth topics. I was struggling with the AJAX to consume a JSON Web Service to get the weather underground weather for your browsers location. The JSON Parse and Stringify didn’t give me as much trouble as I though it was going to. I also had to prepare for teaching about local storage storing and retrieving arrays, associative arrays and objects. This weeks was fairly easy for me. I just ended up having it print out my name state, city, my favorite game and school. We didn’t have anyone teach topic 6 this week because not everyone made it. </p>
	     
	     <h2> Week 6 </h2>
	     <p> Week 6 I was leading the meeting and the topics being taught were Manipulating CSS Class Properties Using JavaScript taught by Jason and CSS3 Transitions and Animations and triggering them with JavaScript taught by Logan. At this point I was a little behind on learning the topics and getting my code updated and uploaded. I wasn’t able to see how well I was doing with the topics with them not being graded for a long time. So I just continued forward with other topics. </p>
		     
	     <h2> Week 7 </h2>
	     <p> This is the last week I had to teach. I was teaching topic 10 about HTML5 Tags like video, audio, and canvas. I was a little behind getting my other topics complete and understanding them, but I took the time to prepare for this meeting. DJ was teaching the other topic of JavaScript Events Especially for Mobile Devices (onTouchBegin) and Animation and Transition Events. After The meeting I ended up trying to focus on the previous topics because I was falling behind. I was starting to feel a little stressed about getting all the topics done before week 10. </p>
