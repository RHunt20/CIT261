	     <h2> Week 2 </h2>
	     <p> This week was the first week we were supposed to get in contact with our groups and meet. As we planned on meeting we discussed our availability a little in the group discussion board. It was a bit of a struggle to get everyone to comment but we were able to get three of us confirmed to meet on Thursday night. Thursday night we met and talked about how we want to go about this class and what days we would like to meet. We set up a schedule of times and who was teaching each week along with who was leading the meeting.</p>
